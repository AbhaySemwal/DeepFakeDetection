### Description

This project aims to develop a deepfake detection tool as part of the Vultr Hackathon. Deepfake technology allows for the manipulation of video and audio to create fake media. This detection tool uses machine learning to analyze video files and detect potential deepfake content.

## Installation

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.


## Installation

To clone and run this project, you’ll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/your-repo/deepfake-detection

# Go into the repository
$ cd deepfake-detection

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```

---

## Usage

1. Upload a video file for analysis.
2. The model processes the video and returns a probability score, indicating the likelihood of deepfake content.
3. Review detection results and download a report of flagged frames.

---

### Tasks

- [x] Develop detection algorithm
- [ ] Implement video upload feature
- [ ] Add probability score display
- [ ] Test model on dataset

---

### Code Example: JavaScript

```javascript
// Basic example for uploading video data and running detection
function runDetection(video) {
    console.log("Uploading video...");
    const detectionResult = analyzeVideo(video);
    console.log("Detection Result:", detectionResult);
}

function analyzeVideo(video) {
    // Simulate detection process
    const probability = Math.random().toFixed(2); 
    return `Probability of Deepfake: ${probability * 100}%`;
}
```

---

### Flowchart

```flow
st=>start: Upload Video
op1=>operation: Pre-process Video
op2=>operation: Analyze for Deepfake
cond=>condition: Detection Confidence > 90%?
e_true=>end: Deepfake Detected
e_false=>end: Genuine Video

st->op1->op2->cond
cond(yes)->e_true
cond(no)->e_false
```

In this flow:

1. **Upload Video**: User uploads a video.
2. **Pre-process Video**: System prepares the video (e.g., resizing, formatting).
3. **Analyze for Deepfake**: Model evaluates video for potential deepfake indicators.
4. **Detection Confidence**: Based on a confidence score, the system labels it as either a deepfake or genuine.
